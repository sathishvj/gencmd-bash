# gencmd
Generate cmd line arguments from the terminal itself. 

You're on your terminal and you're trying to recall the right command line arguments. What's your workflow then? Shift to your browser, run a search, click through multiple links, read through multiple pages, and then finally find the right command line arguments? That's distracting. With `gencmd` your workflow continues in the command line itself.

Uses Google's PaLM API. 

### Moved
Originally wrote it in bash for myself. But realized this is useful for others on other platforms. Rewrote it in Go. You can find it here: [gencmd-go](https://github.com/sathishvj/gencmd-go).
